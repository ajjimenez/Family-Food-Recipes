Family-Food-Recipes
===================

This is the family recipe book...It started as a paper project, but I think this should work much better in the long-term.  

I'm making use of GitHub pages so that my non-technical family members can make easy use of the repo without having to worry about the underlying structure.  The eventual goal is to suck at least a few of them into this world and get some forking and pulling.
