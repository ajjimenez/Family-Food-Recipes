Arroz Caldo
======================
This is my way of doing Arroz Caldo. There were a few things I hated when I ate this growing up (namely shards of bones all up in my porridge)â€¦so I fixed them. It's a bit more work this way, but totally worth it. Want me to make it for you?  Get sick first.

## Ingredients


* Chicken Legs, skin on (Thighs attached to drumsticks) 2ea.
* Ginger peeled and sliced into coins 3-4 coins
* Garlic Cloves 5 cloves
* Rice 1 handfull
* Chicken Stock (Or Knorr Bouillon if you want to keep it dirtay)
* Green Onion chopped

##Instructions

####Crispy Chicken Skin
1. Remove the skin from the Chicken Legs by stripping it off.
2. Cut off and reserve any large parts of fat.
3. Cut the fat into little pieces and add to a pan at medium-low heat to render.
4. Take the skin and first cut into thin strips, then the strips into little pieces.
5. place the pieces into the pan with the rendering fat and cook slowly. First the skin will render more fat, then eventually it will become crispy.
6. Remove the skins and place on paper towels to drain, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.
7. Season the crispy skins while still hot.

####Crispy Garlic
1. To the rendered chicken fat add half of the chopped garlic.
2. Gently cook int the fat until a very light brown.  Don't overcook in the pan as it will continue to brown once removed.
3. Remove the garlic and place on a paper towel to drain. It should end up crispy and golden brown.
4. Reserve some of the chicken fat for later.

####To Finish
1. Debone the drumstick and thighs by making a cut along the bones and scraping off the meat.  Be sure to get any bits of cartilage that adheres to the meat.
2. Toss the bones and cartilage into the pan with the rendered, garlicy chicken fat and brown over medium heat.
3. Add the coins of Ginger followed by the rest of the chopped Garlic.  
4. Once the garlic just starts to brown, add enough cold water to submerge the bones.
5. Bring to a boil then lower the heat and simmer for at least 30 minutes.
6. After 30 minutes, taste the soup and add Knorr or salt if you think it needs it.
7. Strain the bones and bits out and keep the soup.
8. While the soup is simmering, cut up the chicken meat into bite size pieces.
9. Set aside in the refridgerator.
10. Once the soup tastes good and is ready, add the handfull of rice. 
11. Simmer until the rice is cooked to a porridge like consistency (approx 20 min)
12. Once the rice is ready, add the chicken and turn off the heat.
13. Let sit for 5 minutes to gently poach the chicken.
14. Ladle into bowls and garnish with the fried garlic, crispy chicken skin, green onion, and some of the garlicy chicken fat.
