<p>This is the Jimenez family Bistek…you want to make this, trust! No ingredient quantities, because it&#8217;s all to taste.</p>

<h2 id='ingredients'>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Beef Chuck Sliced against the grain into strips</li>

<li>Mushroom Soy Sauce</li>

<li>Soy Sauce</li>

<li>Lemon juiced</li>

<li>Onions sliced into rings</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='instructions'>Instructions</h2>

<h4 id='marinade'>Marinade</h4>

<ol>
<li>Take the chuck strips and place them into a bowl.</li>

<li>Add enough mushroom soy to significantly darken all of the meat.</li>

<li>Add a little water to dilute the mushroom soy. This will serve as the basis for your sabow (sauce).</li>

<li>Add soy sauce to adjust the overall salt level (You bought great meat right? Don&#8217;t be afraid to taste the sauce with the meat then.)</li>

<li>Add the lemon juice to taste.</li>

<li>Let it marinade at least an hour and up to over night.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id='cooking_the_beef_and_making_the_sauce'>Cooking the Beef and making the sauce</h4>

<ol>
<li>Put the meat and the marinade into a pan and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer.</li>

<li>Cook the meat all the way through, anywhere from 10-20 minutes or even longer to make it tender.</li>

<li>Remove the meat when it&#8217;s cooked and set it aside.</li>

<li>Boil the leftover sauce until it tastes like Bistek sauce.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id='cooking_the_onions'>Cooking the onions</h4>

<ol>
<li>Heat up oil in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>

<li>Sautee the onion rings just until the raw onion taste is gone, but not so much that the ring loses its structure. If you don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s done…just taste! You do not want onions that are soft or browned. Set aside and reserve.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id='finishing_the_dish'>Finishing the Dish</h4>

<ol>
<li>Take the cooked meat and put into the hot pan with hot oil from cooking the onions.</li>

<li>Brown Briefly on all sides until it has a nice crust.</li>

<li>Combine the meat with the onions.</li>

<li>Heat up the sauce and pour over the meat and onions.</li>
</ol>
