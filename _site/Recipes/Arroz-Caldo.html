<p>This is my way of doing Arroz Caldo. There were a few things I hated when I ate this growing up (namely shards of bones all up in my porridge)â€¦so I fixed them. It&#8217;s a bit more work this way, but totally worth it. Want me to make it for you? Get sick first.</p>

<h2 id='ingredients'>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Chicken Legs, skin on (Thighs attached to drumsticks) 2ea.</li>

<li>Ginger peeled and sliced into coins 3-4 coins</li>

<li>Garlic Cloves 5 cloves</li>

<li>Rice 1 handfull</li>

<li>Chicken Stock (Or Knorr Bouillon if you want to keep it dirtay)</li>

<li>Green Onion chopped</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='instructions'>Instructions</h2>

<h4 id='crispy_chicken_skin'>Crispy Chicken Skin</h4>

<ol>
<li>Remove the skin from the Chicken Legs by stripping it off.</li>

<li>Cut off and reserve any large parts of fat.</li>

<li>Cut the fat into little pieces and add to a pan at medium-low heat to render.</li>

<li>Take the skin and first cut into thin strips, then the strips into little pieces.</li>

<li>place the pieces into the pan with the rendering fat and cook slowly. First the skin will render more fat, then eventually it will become crispy.</li>

<li>Remove the skins and place on paper towels to drain, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.</li>

<li>Season the crispy skins while still hot.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id='crispy_garlic'>Crispy Garlic</h4>

<ol>
<li>To the rendered chicken fat add half of the chopped garlic.</li>

<li>Gently cook int the fat until a very light brown. Don&#8217;t overcook in the pan as it will continue to brown once removed.</li>

<li>Remove the garlic and place on a paper towel to drain. It should end up crispy and golden brown.</li>

<li>Reserve some of the chicken fat for later.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id='to_finish'>To Finish</h4>

<ol>
<li>Debone the drumstick and thighs by making a cut along the bones and scraping off the meat. Be sure to get any bits of cartilage that adheres to the meat.</li>

<li>Toss the bones and cartilage into the pan with the rendered, garlicy chicken fat and brown over medium heat.</li>

<li>Add the coins of Ginger followed by the rest of the chopped Garlic.</li>

<li>Once the garlic just starts to brown, add enough cold water to submerge the bones.</li>

<li>Bring to a boil then lower the heat and simmer for at least 30 minutes.</li>

<li>After 30 minutes, taste the soup and add Knorr or salt if you think it needs it.</li>

<li>Strain the bones and bits out and keep the soup.</li>

<li>While the soup is simmering, cut up the chicken meat into bite size pieces.</li>

<li>Set aside in the refridgerator.</li>

<li>Once the soup tastes good and is ready, add the handfull of rice.</li>

<li>Simmer until the rice is cooked to a porridge like consistency (approx 20 min).</li>

<li>Once the rice is ready, add the chicken and turn off the heat.</li>

<li>Let sit for 5 minutes to gently poach the chicken.</li>

<li>Ladle into bowls and garnish with the fried garlic, crispy chicken skin, green onion, and some of the garlicy chicken fat.</li>

<li>Feel Better.</li>
