Tessie's 'Gang
======================
Also known as Sinigangâ€¦but like 100x better.

## Ingredients


* Beef Short Ribs 1.5-2lbs
* Onion 1 large, chopped
* lemons 1ea (1 if you're normal, 3 if Kaity)
* tomato 1ea stemmed and chopped
* Fish Sauce to taste
* Rice wash water (The cloudy water that you get after washing your rice, and before you cook it)
* jalapenos 1-2 (If you use pickled peppers then you're making Tagayugang )
* Knorr Sinigang seasoning to taste
* Daikon Radish peeled and cut into rounds
* Mustard Greens
* Chinese Eggplant cut into rounds


##Instructions

1. Add Beef Ribs to a hot 3.5qt pot with some cooking oil, add the onions and lemon and sautee briefly so that the beef cooks and gets flavored with the lemon and onions, but not so much that it browns.
2. Add the tomato and fish sauce, cook some more.
3. Add the rice wash water until all the meat is covered. If you don't have enough rice wash water, just add regular water.
4. Add the jalapenos then add some of the Knorr Sinigang seasoning to your taste.  You can always add more at the end.
5. Bring to a boil, then lover the heat until it just simmers.
6. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
7. Add the daikon and the eggplant, and simmer for 20 more minutes. Check if the daikon and eggplant are fully cooked.
8. Taste and adjust with lemon, salt or Knorr.
9. Add the Mustard Greens and simmer until just wilted.
10. Serve with rice (not optional), soy sauce(optional) and fish sauce(optional).

Tastes even better the next day.  If making a day ahead, do everything as above, but do not add the mustard greens until you're ready to heat up the gang and serve it.
