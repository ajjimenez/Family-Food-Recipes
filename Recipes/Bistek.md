Bistek
======================
This is the Jimenez family Bistek…you want to make this, trust!  No ingredient quantities, because it's all to taste.

## Ingredients


* Beef Chuck Sliced against the grain into strips
* Mushroom Soy Sauce
* Soy Sauce
* Lemon juiced
* Onions sliced into rings


##Instructions

####Marinade
1. Take the chuck strips and place them into a bowl.
2. Add enough mushroom soy to significantly darken all of the meat.
3. Add a little water to dilute the mushroom soy.  This will serve as the basis for your sabow (sauce).
4. Add soy sauce to adjust the overall salt level (You bought great meat right?  Don't be afraid to taste the sauce with the meat then.)
5. Add the lemon juice to taste.
6. Let it marinade at least an hour and up to over night.

####Cooking the Beef and making the sauce

1. Put the meat and the marinade into a pan and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer.
2. Cook the meat all the way through, anywhere from 10-20 minutes or even longer to make it tender.
3. Remove the meat when it's cooked and set it aside.
4. Boil the leftover sauce until it tastes like Bistek sauce.

####Cooking the onions
1. Heat up oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
2. Sautee the onion rings just until the raw onion taste is gone, but not so much that the ring loses its structure.  If you don't know if it's done…just taste!  You do not want onions that are soft or browned.  Set aside and reserve.

####Finishing the Dish
1. Take the cooked meat and put into the hot pan with hot oil from cooking the onions.
2. Brown Briefly on all sides until it has a nice crust.
3. Combine the meat with the onions.
4. Heat up the sauce and pour over the meat and onions.
