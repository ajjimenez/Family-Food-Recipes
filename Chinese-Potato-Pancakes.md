Chinese Potato Pancakes
======================
These are Steph's favorite. Just a little tweaked from normal potato pancakes.

## Ingredients


* Idaho Russet Potatoes 
* lap choeng (Chinese Sausage) cut into small pieces
* Knorr Chicken Bouillon


##Instructions

1. Peel and grate the potatoes then rinse and drain to remove some of the surface starch.
2. Add the lap choeng and mix well
3. Season with the Chicken Bouillon as if it were salt.
4. Fry silver-dollar sized pancakes in a pan with oil until browned on both sides.
