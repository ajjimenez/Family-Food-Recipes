Macaroni Soup
======================
Kind of in the tradition of Hong Kong Macaroni and Ham soup…except this is my Dad's version.

## Ingredients


* Ground Beef 1.5 lbs (80% lean)
* Onions 1.5 large chopped fine
* Garlic cloves 3 smashed and chopped
* Black Pepper
* Kraft Parmesan cheese (The green can!, Although I won't kill you if you use real cheese)
* Knorr Chicken Bouillon (Only if you want to be authentic…again, I ain't hatin on home made chicken broth)
* Elbow Macaroni a handfull


##Instructions

1. Heat up a pan with oil over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped garlic, and when fragrant, add the onions.
3. When the onions have softened, add the ground beef and sautee until the beef has browned well.
4. Add water until it looks like a good soup.
5. Add Chicken Bouillon until it tastes like soup.  Be conservative since you can always add more at the end.
6. Add parmesan
7. Bring to a boil then lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
8. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
9. Add Macaroni and simmer until the macaroni's done.
